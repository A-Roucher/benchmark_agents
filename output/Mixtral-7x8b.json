Other Bishops of London who gave their names to nearby streets were Mellitus, Earconwald, Osmund, Wulfstan, Gilbert Foliot, Richard FitzNeal, John Stokesley and Humphrey Henchman.\nThe street is notable as the location of the Massacre of Braybrook Street where three police officers were murdered by Harry Roberts and John Duddy in August 1966.\n\nPage: Police Dependants' Trust\nSummary: The Police Dependants' Trust is a body which looks after the interest and welfare of the families of British police officers who have died or been incapacitated as a result of injury while on duty.\nIt was set up in 1966 from financial donations which flooded in after three officers in London were shot dead in cold blood by three men whose car they had stopped for a routine inspection (Massacre of Braybrook Street). The initial contributor was holiday camp owner Billy Butlin, who anonymously donated \u00a3100,000. Public donations soon swelled the fund to one million pounds.\nThe three killers were all given life sentences. One of them died behind bars in 1981, while another was released on licence after 25 years, he died, murdered, eight years later.

The murders took place after plainclothes officers approached a Standard Vanguard estate car, in which Roberts and two other men were sitting in Braybrook Street near Wormwood Scrubs prison in London. Roberts feared the officers would discover firearms his gang were planning to use in a robbery. He killed two, while one of his accomplices shot dead the third.After Roberts had spent nearly 48 years in prison, in 2014 the Parole Board for England and Wales approved his release, at the age of 78. Having far exceeded his minimum term of 30 years, he was one of the United Kingdom's longest-serving prisoners, having remained in custody since 1966. His release was controversial due to the nature of his crime.\n\nPage: Night Court\nSummary: Night Court is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC for nine seasons and 193 episodes, from January 4, 1984, to May 31, 1992.
