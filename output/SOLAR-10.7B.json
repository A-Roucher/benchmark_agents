It was first presented in the 1993 season, and was won by Nathan Buckley, playing for the Brisbane Bears. The recipient of the AFL Rising Star has been awarded the Ron Evans Medal since 2007, named in honour of the former AFL Commission chairman following his death that year.The award was sponsored by Norwich Union Australia from its inception in 1993 until 2000. The AFL then secured a six-year sponsorship deal with Ansett Australia in 2001 that included the Rising Star award; however, this agreement only lasted the one season following the collapse of Ansett in September 2001. National Australia Bank sponsored the award for two decades from 2002 to 2022, marking the longest commercial partnership in the award's history; they were not replaced by any sponsor for the 2023 edition. An equivalent award has existed in the AFL Women's league since its inception in 2017.The clubs with the most AFL Rising Star awards are Fremantle, Melbourne and Sydney, with three awards won by players representing these teams. Greater Western Sydney's eight nominations in the 2012 season is the most any club has achieved in a season.

It was founded in 1889 by a group of women led by young student activist Annie Nathan Meyer, who petitioned Columbia University's trustees to create an affiliated college named after Columbia's recently deceased 10th president, Frederick A.P. Barnard. The college is one of the original Seven Sisters\u2014seven liberal arts colleges in the Northeastern United States that were historically women's colleges.\nBarnard is currently one of four Columbia undergraduate colleges with independent admission, curriculum, and financials. Students share classes, libraries, clubs, Greek life, athletic fields, and dining halls with Columbia, as well as sports teams, through the Columbia-Barnard Athletic Consortium, an agreement that makes Barnard the only women's college to offer its students the ability to compete in NCAA Division I athletics. Students receive their diploma from Columbia University.\nBarnard offers Bachelor of Arts degree programs in about 50 areas of study. Students may also pursue elements of their education at Columbia, the Juilliard School, the Manhattan School of Music, and The Jewish Theological Seminary, which are also based in New York City. Its 4-acre (1.6 ha) campus is located in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights, stretching along Broadway between 116th and 120th Streets. It is directly across from Columbia's main campus.\nBarnard College alumnae include leaders in science, religion, politics, the Peace Corps, medicine, law, education, communications, theater, and business. Barnard graduates have been recipients of Emmy, Tony, Grammy, Academy, and Peabody Awards, Guggenheim Fellowships, MacArthur Fellowships, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Science, and the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nPage: Seven Sisters (colleges)\nSummary: The Seven Sisters are a group of seven liberal arts colleges in the Northeastern United States that are historically women's colleges: Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and Wellesley College are still women's colleges. Vassar College is currently a coeducational college and Radcliffe College was absorbed in 1999 by Harvard College.\nThese colleges were created to provide women with the educational equivalent to the historically all-male Ivy League colleges, although Cornell has accepted women since its founding. \nThe name Seven Sisters is a reference to the Greek myth of The Pleiades, the seven daughters of the Titan Atlas and the sea-nymph Pleione: Maia, Electra, Taygete, Alcyone, Celaeno, Sterope, and Merope.\n\n\n\nPage: List of Barnard College people\nSummary: The following is a list of notable individuals associated with Barnard College through attendance as a student, service as a member of the faculty or staff, or award of the Barnard Medal of Distinction."}], "parsing_error": false, "iteration_limit_exceeded": false, "agent_error": null, "start_time": "2023-12-18 10:52:54", "end_time": "2023-12-18 10:53:24", "task": "HotpotQA-medium", "eval_score_GPT4": "1", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "Feedback: The response provided is not a college name but rather the name of an individual, which does not answer the question about which of the Seven Sisters colleges had a Columbia University administrator as one of its Presidents.

While most people think they know the difference between the two, the truth is that it's not always clear-cut. In general, the main difference between fruits and vegetables is that fruits come from the flowers of plants and contain seeds, while vegetables come from other parts of the plant, such as stems, leaves, and roots. Fruits are the reproductive parts of flowering plants. They develop from the ovary of the flower and contain seeds, which are necessary for the plant's reproduction. Fruits are generally sweet and juicy, and they are often eaten raw or used in desserts. Some examples of fruits include apples, oranges, bananas, grapes, and berries. Vegetables, on the other hand, are the edible parts of the plant that are not fruits. They can come from any part of the plant other than the ovary, such as the leaves, stems, or roots.
