    "# Open-source LLM's as Agents with `ChatHuggingFace`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source LLMs are becoming viable general purpose agents. The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how to make use of open-source LLMs as chat models using [Hugging Face Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) with [LangChain's `ChatHuggingFace`]() to enable their usage and experimentation with agent-based workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will:\n",
    "1. Utilize the [HuggingFaceEndpoint](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/huggingface_endpoint.py) (or [HuggingFaceTextGenInference](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/huggingface_text_gen_inference.py) or [HuggingFaceHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/huggingface_hub.py)) integration to call a [HF Inference Endpoint](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints) that's serving an LLM via [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index)\n",
    "2. Utilize the `ChatHuggingFace` class that interfaces between LangChain's [Chat Messages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/chat/#messages) and the hosted LLM by leveraging [Hugging Face's Chat Templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/chat_templating) to power a `ChatAgent` pipeline.\n",
    "4. Demonstrate how to use an open-source LLM in a zero-shot ReAct Agent workflow, along with an open-source [Prometheus](https://huggingface.co/papers/2310.08491) model to perform \"LLM as a Judge\"-style evaluations on that Agent's ouputs.\n",
    "5. Understand how several different open-source LLM's perform as general purpose agents by running an asynchronous evaluation pipeline using Prometheus as the judge. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: To run this notebook, you'll need to have:\n",
    "> - an LLM deployed via a Hugging Face Inference Endpoint (the LLM must have a `chat_template` defined in its `tokenizer_config.json`)\n",
    "> - A Hugging Face Token with access to the deployed endpoint saved as an environment variable: `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`\n",
    "> - A SerpAPI key saved as an environment variable: `SERPAPI_API_KEY`\n"
